# Explanation

in this program i create two func `keliling(phi int, r int) int` `luas(phi int, r int) int`

in keliling func to calculate the result i use L = phi x r x r so user can passing two datas one for pi and the second one is for r

in func luas same with keliling func user can passing two datas one for pi and the second one is for r but in this func I use K = 2 x phi x r
